# Predictive Data Analysis
<br>
This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of predictive data analysis techniques applied to the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The project employs various machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes, identifies the best-performing model based on accuracy, and goes beyond traditional methods by implementing neural networks from scratch. The project also evaluates the results using a variety of metrics.
